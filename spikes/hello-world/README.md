# hello-world

A server-rendered gsx app with Vite assets and live reload.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Node.js 18+ with npm — for Vite, which bundles this template's CSS and
  JavaScript. gsx itself needs only Go; the built server runs without Node.

## Setup

```sh
go get -tool github.com/gsxhq/gsx/cmd/gsx@latest
go mod tidy
npm install
```

## Develop

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed in the terminal. Edit `app.gsx` and save to rebuild the Go
server and reload the browser.

Generated `*.x.go` files are ignored. Do not edit or commit them.

## Production build

```sh
npm run build
go tool gsx generate
go build -o app
./app
```

The server listens on `:7777` and embeds the built assets, so the binary is the
only thing you deploy — no Node.js, npm install, or Vite in production.
